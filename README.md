# STM8-SSD1306
Extremely simple library to disable numbers on displays using the SSD1306 driver

# NOTE
This implementation has a couple of problems the most notable of which is, 
if the new number being displayed has less digits then the current those digits remain 
for me this is not a problem since i only display 3 digit numbers
